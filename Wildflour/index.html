			<h2>Welcome to West Ashley</h2>
			<blockquote>West Ashley or, as it is more formally known, West of the Ashley is actually not its own city, but rather a vibrant district of Charleston located on ‘the other side’ of the Ashley River. In fact, its residents account for almost half of the city’s 120,000+ residents. West Ashley is flanked by the scenic waterfront vistas and marshes of the Ashley and Stono Rivers and colored by its famed ancient moss draped oak trees. Its initial neighborhoods were developed in the 1950s with its largest growth occurring throughout the 1970s and 80s. Its commercial and residential popularity exploded with the building of Interstate 526 the early 1980s and the Glenn McConnell Parkway in the 1990s. Today, it boasts inviting neighborhoods and funky retailers and restaurants as well as big box retailers and its own ‘auto mile.’ West Ashley is also home to great natural beauty and a large slice of history. Middleton Place, Ashley Hall and Magnolia Plantation are situated there as is Charles Towne Landing.</blockquote>
