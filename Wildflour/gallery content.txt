We were pleasantly surprised to find you guys open on Easter Sunday. The cute little bunny cupcakes were a hit with all of us, especially our five-year-old!

Every Tuesday I walk to your bakery and order a lemon blueberry scone. It is the highlight of my week and I'm always greeted with a cheerful voice. So glad you all are here.

Found this little gem of a bakery when we were staying with our dear friends last week in Charleston, South Carolina. They have such a wonderful assortment of treats! Highly recommend.

I like to grab a cookie after my long run on the Greenway and eat it with milk back at the house. The ladies behind the counter always seem happy to see me and ask how far I ran.
