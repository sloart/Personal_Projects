#Particles and Bokeh

I'm kind of obsessed with memory and stories and webs. The web of memory. The way you can get from point A to point B by a thousand different paths.
IRL I also spin very thin thread from weird fibers like luna moth cocoons and kitten fur. And I turn that thread into webs.
So this project is my personal playground where I'm trying to merge the digital and physical webs,
and
and come up with something beautiful and ethereal.
